# Image Tools

The [`vite-imagetools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-imagetools) plugin gives us easy access to a bunch of image transformations using Vite. The most _appropriate_ use of this plugin is for reducing file sizes and making `srcset`s on the fly. That said there are a lot of other fun ideas.

## Exercise

Take a look at the [documentation for other directives](https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/imagetools/blob/main/docs/directives.md#directives). What other directives might be interesting to try out? Feel free to grab some other pictures off the Internet.
