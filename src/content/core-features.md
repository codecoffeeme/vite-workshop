# Core Features

Vite is a build tool and development server that is designed to make web development, particularly for modern JavaScript applications, faster and more efficient. It was created with the goal of improving the developer experience by leveraging native ES modules (ESM) in modern browsers and adopting a new, innovative approach to development and bundling. Here are the core features of Vite:

1. **Fast Development Server**: One of Vite's standout features is its incredibly fast development server. It leverages native ES modules (ESM) in modern browsers to provide lightning-fast loading and updates during development. This means that your changes are reflected in the browser almost instantly, thanks to features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
2. **Native ES Modules (ESM)**: Vite takes advantage of the native ES modules support in modern browsers, allowing you to use `import` and `export` statements directly in your code without the need for bundling during development. This speeds up the development process by eliminating the bundling step for ESM-supported browsers.
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Vite offers a simple and intuitive configuration system. Developers can configure their project's settings using a `vite.config.js` file, making it easy to customize build and development options to suit specific project requirements.
4. **Asset Handling**: Vite handles various assets, including images, fonts, and other static resources, allowing you to import and use them directly in your code. It automatically processes and optimizes these assets during production builds.
5. **CSS Handling**: Vite supports a variety of CSS solutions, including native CSS modules, PostCSS for advanced CSS transformations, and various CSS preprocessors like SCSS and Less. This flexibility makes it easy to manage styles in your project.
6. **Plugin System**: Vite provides a plugin system that allows developers to extend its functionality. You can find and use various plugins from the Vite ecosystem or create custom plugins to tailor Vite to your project's specific needs.
7. **Efficient Production Builds**: When it comes to production, Vite produces highly optimized and tree-shaken builds. It automatically analyzes your code to eliminate dead code paths, reducing the bundle size for faster loading times.
8. **Multiple Framework Support**: While initially designed for Vue.js, Vite is not limited to any specific JavaScript framework. You can use it with Vue, React, or even vanilla JavaScript projects.
9. **Active Development and Community**: Vite is actively developed and has a growing community. This means you can expect regular updates, bug fixes, and an expanding ecosystem of plugins and tools.
