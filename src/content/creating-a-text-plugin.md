# Creating a Plugin for Importing Text

Vite has garnered a lot of attention due to its speed and simplicity. One of the key features that make Vite a powerful tool is its plugin system. While there are many community-contributed plugins available, there may be times you need something more specific for your project. This tutorial will guide you through the process of writing your own custom Vite plugin.

## The Anatomy of a Vite Plugin

At its most basic, a Vite plugin is an object with a set of properties that correspond to different hook functions. Here is a simple template for a Vite plugin:

```javascript
export default {
	name: 'my-vite-plugin',
	apply: 'build', // Specify when the plugin should be run (either 'serve' for dev server, 'build' for builds, or omit to always run)
	configResolved(config) {
		// This is called once the config is resolved.
	},
	load(id) {
		// Override the load phase for specific modules.
	},
	transform(code, id) {
		// Transform a given code snippet.
	}
};
```

There are some other hooks, but that's enough to get us started.

## Writing Your First Custom Plugin

Let's write a simple plugin that transforms all `.txt` files into JSON objects containing the file content.

### 1. Set Up the Plugin Structure

Create a file called `my-vite-plugin.js` and set up a basic structure:

```javascript
export default function myVitePlugin() {
	return {
		name: 'transform-txt',
		transform(code, id) {
			if (id.endsWith('.txt')) {
				return `export default ${JSON.stringify(code)}`;
			}
		}
	};
}
```

### Use the Plugin in a Vite Project

Create a simple Vite project or use an existing one and install the plugin as a dependency:

```bash
npm install path/to/your/plugin/directory
```

Add the plugin to your `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
import myVitePlugin from 'my-vite-plugin';

export default {
	plugins: [myVitePlugin()]
};
```

### Test the Plugin

Create a sample `.txt` file in your project and import it in a JavaScript file:

```javascript
import textContent from './sample.txt';
console.log(textContent);
```

When you run `vite build`, the content of the `.txt` file should be transformed into a JSON object and printed to the console.
